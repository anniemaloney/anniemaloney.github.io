Annie Maloney is a specialist in seventeenth-century Italian art, with a focus on the history of antiquarianism and early modern painting. Her recently completed dissertation, "Saving Roman Painting: The Antiquarian Reproductions of Pietro Santi Bartoli," addresses questions about the study of ancient frescoes among Baroque painters and antiquarians. Maloney argues that Pietro Santi Bartoli was among the first artist-antiquarians to propose a history of ancient painting using surviving material evidence and that his efforts led to a renewed interest in ancient Roman fresco among contemporary artists in Italy, France, and England.

Recently Maloney has turned her attention to the practice of comparative antiquarianism in the early modern world through an examination of the ways in which European collectors displayed ancient objects alongside objects from Asia and the Americas. She has presented her work at the Renaissance Society of America Conference, the Middle Atlantic Symposium for the History of Art, and the Zentralinstitut f√ºr Kunstgeschichte in Munich. Maloney will be offering courses on Global Baroque Art, Italian Baroque architecture, antiquarianism, and cabinets of curiosity at Brown this year. Before teaching at Brown Maloney served as a visiting lecturer at Oxford College of Emory University and Oberlin College. She completed her doctoral work at Emory University in 2023.
